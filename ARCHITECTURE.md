# Dynamic pricing system architecture

## Overview
This dynamic pricing system machine learning algorithms, real time data processing, 
And microsarvis architecture to optimize prices in real time for e-commerce platforms.

## core component

### 1. Machine learning model
- ** DQN (Deep Q-Network) **: Strengthening teaching agent for pricing optimization
- ** LSTM **: Long -term short -term memory network for demand forecast  
- ** xgboost **: Promoting the shield for price elastic analysis

### 2. Microservis architecture
- ** Pricing API Service **: Fastapi-based rest for pricing optimization
- ** Event Streaming **: Apache Kafka for real -time phenomenon processing
- ** Caching layer **: Radice for high-demonstration data cashing
- ** database **: postgresql for frequent storage

### 3. Infrastructure
- ** Containment **: Docker for frequent deployment
- ** Orcastation **: Kuberanets for Scalable Container Management
- ** Monitoring **: Prometheus + Grafana for System Observibility
- ** Load Balancing **: NGINX to distribute traffic

## data flow
1. Real-time market data flows through Kafka stream
2. ML models process data and generate pricing recommendations
3. API Layer Customized Prices with Sub-Second Liability Acide
4. Results are cash in redis for immediate future requests
5. All events are logged in for analytics and model retrening

## deployment
The system is designed to be a cloud-country and can be deployed:
- Kuberanets Cluster
- Docker herd
- Cloud platform (AWS, GCP, Azure)

## Display characteristics
- ** Flightness **: Sub -100MS Pricing Recommendations
- ** Thruput **: 10,000+ requests per second
- ** Availability **: 99.9% uptime with auto-scaling
- ** Scalability **: Horizontal Scaling based on demand
